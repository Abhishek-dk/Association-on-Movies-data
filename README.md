## Association Rule Learning
Association Rule learning is a rule-based machine learning technique which is used to find interesting relationships and associations hidden in large data-sets. This rule shows how frequently an itemset occurs in a dataset or transaction.

Market Based Analysis is one of the important methods used by large relations to show associations between items. Given a set of transactions or dataset, we can find rules that will predict the occurrence of specific item based on the occurrences of other items in the dataset.

## Support
Support indicates how frequently an item or item-set appears in the dataset or transaction.

## Confidence
Confidence indicates how frequently a rule is found to be true.

## Lift
Lift (A →B) indicates the rise in probability of occurrence of B when A has already occurred.

For a rule, if {A} →{B} has high confidence, then it indicates that B is more likely to occur with A.
For rule {A} →{B}

# Apriori Algorithm
Apriori algorithm is a standard algorithm in Association Rule Learning in Data mining. It is used for drawing familiar item sets and their relevant association rules. It is designed to perform on a database.

It is very important for effective Market Basket Analysis and it helps in understanding the businessman that which items customers will buy together. It has also been used in healthcare field for the discovery of adverse drug reactions. It generates association rules that shows what are all combinations of medications and patient characteristics which will help in effective drug delivering.
